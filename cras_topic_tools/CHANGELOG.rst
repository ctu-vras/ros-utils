Changelog for package cras_topic_tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.2.3 (2023-06-16)
------------------

2.2.2 (2023-05-15)
------------------

2.2.1 (2023-05-15)
------------------

2.2.0 (2023-04-09)
------------------
* Added heartbeat.
* Simplified lazy subscriber classes and nodelet code. Added ~tcp_no_delay param to most nodelets. API breaks included, but hopefully nothing will be affected.
  API breaks:
  - LazySubscriberBase->ConditionalSubscriber
  - LazySubscriber: callback is now passed as parameter instead of being a virtual member function
  - GenericLazyPubSub: callback is now passed as parameter instead of being a virtual member function
  - the nodelets no longer have a dedicated PubSub object that would be reusable elsewhere (the minimum probability of reuse does not outweigh the code complications it brings)
