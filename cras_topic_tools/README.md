# cras\_topic\_tools

Nodes and nodeletes for safe and efficient manipulation with topics.
Mostly supplementing what is missing from `topic_tools` and `nodelet_topic_tools`.

## Support and Build Status

This package is supported on Melodic and Noetic until their End of Life (and maybe later). It is occasionally tested with non-default GCC versions like Melodic+GCC8 or Noetic+GCC11.

## Provided Nodes and Nodelets

Here is an overview of the provided nodes and nodelets. See their [API docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/api/cras_topic_tools/html/) for details.
Most of these nodes/nodelets are message-type-agnostic, but they may differ between messages that have or do not have a `std_msgs/Header header` field.

- `change_header`: Allows modifying headers of messages (frame ID, timestamp).
- `count_messages`: Count the number of received messages and make it available as a ROS parameter.
- `filter`: (only node, no nodelet) Filter messages on a topic based on a Python expression.
- `heartbeat`: Publish `cras_msgs/Heartbeat` heartbeat of a topic.
- `mux_replay`: (only node, no nodelet) Control a `mux` with a recording of its `~selected` topic as if it were live.
- `priority_mux`: Inspired by `twist_mux`, provides a hierarchical way of switching output topics. Works for all message types and for multiple output topics.
- `relay`: Simple relay with the possibility of lazy subscription.
- `repeat`: Increase the frequency of a topic (with various trigger modes etc.).
- `throttle_messages`: Throttle down frequency of a topic - to an exact value, not using the imprecise algorithm from `topic_tools throttle`.

A few convenience libraries for working with generic topics are also provided:

- `shape_shifter`: Easily get the buffer or header of a `ShapeShifter` message or convert a message to `ShapeShifter`. Also contains a safe-to-use version of `ShapeShifter` for Melodic with fixed memory corruption problems.
- `lazy_subscriber`: Base class for all lazy subscribers.
- `generic_lazy_pub_sub`: Base implementation of a generic pair of publisher-subscriber of a type not known at compile type.
