/**
 * \brief Nodelet for repeating messages coming at a slower rate (or even just a single message).
 *
 * ROS parameters:
 * - `~in_queue_size` (uint, default 10): Queue size for the subscriber.
 * - `~out_queue_size` (uint, default $in_queue_size): Queue size for the publisher.
 * - `~rate` (Hz, positive double, default 1.0): The desired rate of the published messages.
 * - `~lazy` (bool, default False): Whether to shut down the subscriber when the publisher has no subscribers.
 *                                  The `~input` topic will be subscribed in the beginning, and will unsubscribe
 *                                  automatically after the first message is received (this is needed to determine the
 *                                  full type of the topic to publish). This can have unexpected consequences as the
 *                                  nodelet doesn't listen for new messages that came in when the publisher had no
 *                                  subscribers. So when the nodelet should start publishing again, it will repeat the
 *                                  last message it received before unsubscribing.
 * - `~tcp_no_delay` (bool, default False): If True, the `TCP_NODELAY` flag is set for the subscriber. This should
 *                                         decrease the latency of small messages, but might give suboptimal
 *                                         transmission speed for large messages.
 * - `~max_age` (double, no default): If set, this parameter instructs the repeater to check how old the re-published
 *                                    message would be. If it is older than `ros::Time::now() - max_age`, it will no
 *                                    longer be published. This setting requires that the type of the message contains a
 *                                    Header field at the beginning. Setting it on header-less topics can cause
 *                                    unexpected behavior and random rejection of messages.
 * - `~max_repeats` (uint, no default): If set, this parameter tells how many times a single message can be repeated.
 * - `~discard_older_messages` (bool, default false): If true, incoming messages' time stamp will be compared to the
 *                                                    last stored message, and if the incoming message is older than the
 *                                                    stored one, it will be discarded. This setting requires that the
 *                                                    type of the message contains a Header field at the beginning.
 *                                                    Setting it on header-less topics can cause unexpected behavior
 *                                                    and random rejection of messages.
 * - `~reset_on_msg` (bool, default true): Whether the internal repeating timer should be reset to count from 0 when an
 *                                         incoming message is stored.
 * - `~publish_only_on_timer` (bool, default false): If true, messages are only published on timer events. If false,
 *                                                   they are also published right away as they come on the input topic.
 *
 * Subscribed topics:
 * - `~input` (any type): The input messages. If `lazy` is true, it will only be subscribed when `~output` has some
 *                        subscribers.
 * - `~reset` (any type): When a message is received on this topic, the repeater is reset into its initial state
 *                        (i.e. the last received message is discarded). This should happen every time the ROS time
 *                        jumps, e.g. when simulation is reset or a bag file starts playing again.
 *
 * Published topics:
 * - `~output` (same type as `~input`): The output messages.
 *
 * Command-line arguments:
 * This nodelet (or node) can also be called with some arguments passed on command line. This means you can
 * pass CLI arguments specifying the topics to subscribe/publish and the rate.
 * - `rosrun cras_topic_tools repeat TOPIC_IN RATE [TOPIC_OUT]`
 *   - `TOPIC_IN`: The topic to subscribe. It is resolved against parent namespace of the node(let) (as opposed to the
 *                 `~input` topic which is resolved against the private node(let) namespace).
 *   - `RATE`: The output rate. If both this argument and `~rate` parameter are specified, the ROS parameter wins.
 *   - `TOPIC_OUT`: The topic to publish. It is resolved against parent namespace of the node(let) (as opposed to the
 *                  `~output` topic which is resolved against the private node(let) namespace). If not specified, output
 *                  topic will be `${TOPIC_IN}_repeat`.
 *
 * \note If `reset_on_msg` and `publish_only_on_timer` are both true and the rate of the incoming messages is higher
 *       than `rate` parameter, no message will ever be published by this repeater (the timer will get reset earlier
 *       than it can ever fire).
