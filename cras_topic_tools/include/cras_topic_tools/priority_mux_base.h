 * \brief A class for priority-based muxing of topics.

 * output topics which several input topics are aiming for. Priorities are assigned to each input topic to decide which
 * one gets access to its desired output. A validity period is also assigned to each input topic which needs to be
 * renewed whenever a message is received from the topic. An input topic can be disabled explicitly via a topic.
